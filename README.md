# TO DO LIST

## To do list

### **Drafting/importing**

* [x] Import all existing content currently hosted on provider resources page.
* [x] Edit all pages for new context and do first round of editing to streamline/improve as needed
* [x] Create a style guide to evolve over course of project

### **Initial review & tidy-up**

* [x] Initial review by Sophia and Caroline
* [ ] Fine-tune post initial review --> aim to be done by Tuesday Dec 7
  * [ ] Review existing comments and resolve any that have been completed (Caroline)
  * [x] Review existing comments tagged for Sophia
  * [x] Draft [sFTP ](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MiNbOTSxTY4PuIFQpDb/reporting-covid-inventory/report-COVID-inventory/sFTP)page or do as a phase 2 and just add "contact us for info about this option" (Sophia)
  * [x] [Fed page](broken-reference) - still needs more work or discussion? --> First draft done, Suzanne will do some light copyediting
  * [x] Discuss changing the [about](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mhss\_HXW8CDoQmWCJNd/s/-MiNbOTSxTY4PuIFQpDb/) page to focus on Vaccines.gov (everyone @ next meeting)
  * [ ] Update images that have been tagged as out-of-date (Sophia)
  * [x] Review [commonly asked questions](common-helpdesk-questions.md#common-questions-via-helpdesk-contact-us-form) received by help desks to make sure they are covered (Suzanne)
  * [x] Check that each page has a URL that matches the page title (it'll do this automatically when you first title the page but if you later change the title, it doesn't update) (Suzanne)
  * [x] Once Sophia finishes the sFTP page, we can point to it from the FAQ, Display, and maybe other places re: "How do I get appointment availability to show up for my location?"
  * [x] Pages ready for Caroline to look at again:
    * [x] [About page](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mhss\_HXW8CDoQmWCJNd/s/-MiNbOTSxTY4PuIFQpDb/)

### **Final review & quality control**

* [ ] Tidy
  * [ ] Pages presented in the best order for users?
  * [ ] Is it clear for each group what their steps are?
  * [ ] Are the global nav links set to the best options?
  * [ ] Make sure all internal links still work
* [ ] CDC - thorough review --> Caroline to facilitate
  * [x] Figure out workflow for next phase of editing with more people reviewing - give editing powers or just comments? Keep with live editing (and ask that they comment next to anything they edit so it's easy to notice) or switch to the other editing mode?
    * [x] Give full edit powers
  * [x] Have the reviewers read the style guide first - or helpful for me to do a 30 min review of it?
  * [x] Compare with source files to make sure nothing important got missed
  * [ ] Do alongside actually stepping through the process with the platform
* [x] Test drive it (before or after CDC review?) --> caroline will do, after Caroline and Leslie review
  * [x] Ask CARS team to review and give feedback?
  * [ ] Ask selected provider to review it (maybe one onboarding?)
  * [ ] Sophia will have a few Castlight support people look it over
* [ ] Revise and respond to ^^ comments
* [x] Find out if we need to translate to Spanish at some point but not necessarily for launch (Caroline) --> no, we do not per CarolineW & Leslie Lee.

### Launch it

(these will need decisions and dev tickets)

* [ ] Establish editing workflow for post-launch and training for people involved in editing
* [ ] Make GB publicly viewable
* [ ] Update link in footer of Vaccines.gov OR add large message at the top to say old docs are going away by x date and link to gitbook.
* [ ] Remove people who no longer need editing / admin powers (primarily USDS but maybe others)

### Post launch (6 month approval)

CDC procured Gitbook in August 2021 and we started to move the content in and make improvements. In October, CDC realized that their 508 office hadn't been involved in the procurement and that Gitbook has significant accessibility issues that can't be resolved. Since so much progress was already made, the 508 office granted a 6 month waiver to go ahead and use Gitbook while working out a better longer term option so we decided to do just that.\
In November 2021, we (Suzanne-USDS, Sophia-Caslight, and Cynthia, Caroline W, and Fred Smith-CDC) discussed and decided on this as a possible longer term solutions: "Fred thinks his team might be able to set it up so we can continue to use gitbook as the CMS internally then deliver the content as a sort of microsite. Next step for this is to have his dev have a look at the draft content". Access was given but as of December 2021, we have not had any follow-up discussions.\\

Other related details that were shared that could be useful in the future:

* Could look something like [https://sprint.usds.gov/](https://sprint.usds.gov/) (which is open source so we can maybe repurpose the code)
* Could be set up with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Should be able to use gitbook/github sync feature to get content into github
* Might be able to use [gitbook/github sync](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/git-sync) to use gitbook as the CMS (and all its editing & collaboration features) by keeping access to gitbook private and pushing content to github to be served up
* Could be hosted on COVID.locating.health or [Vaccines.gov](http://vaccines.gov/)

If later another solution is needed, here were our goals for the chosen solution:\
Our ideal future solution would include:

* Ability to track draft changes / collaborate / have an approval workflow
* Easy editing and publishing (so it doesn’t require a code release)
* Ability to have local navigation so content can be structured (simple side menu with nested pages)
* Leverage work already done in gitbook

## Past Decisions

* Jurisdictions are no longer onboarding so we don't actually need to include their onboarding info - just some intro text somewhere to acknowledge this group exists and to contact us if they need to change anything.
* Keeping COVID and FLU separate does make sense since some providers are just doing one of the two.
* The current provider resources page links to 6 cdc.gov pages. 4 of these show how data appears on vaccines.gov and would be easy to recreate in gitbook. The other pages (and some more pages linked from them) are bigger question marks. --> Caroline says: "We would like to move forward with Option 1 and recreate the checklist information on Gitbook, then pull down the cdc.gov checklists. If there are links to these checklist pages on other CDC.gov pages, we can add the Gitbook link instead. I can coordinate that effort on the CDC side"
* The [Data Import](https://www.vaccines.gov/resources/Data.Import.Document\_V3.0.2\_06\_04\_21\_FINAL.pdf) doc. Confirm this is true: seems to cover topics already included in other sections (like general intro, how to register, location settings, manual inventory upload, etc.) but the part that's not already covered is about how to create your own file of data instead of using the template offered... but you still upload that file via the COVID Locating Health Platform. --> Sophia says "true!
* As of Dec 2021, we do not need to do Spanish translations (per Caroline W and Leslie Lee)
