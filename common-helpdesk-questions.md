# Common Helpdesk Questions

### Common questions from CARS

1. _Welcome/registration email resends = not using correct email associated with correct provider account, it's over 7 days so it expired, or just can't find the email - maybe in spam or junk folder --> covered in_ [_create your account_](broken-reference)
2. _Public Display not working / Missing locations = locations just not showing up in Vaccines.gov but they should be there (because they have it set to not public or there's actually a problem) --> covered in misc places plus added to FAQ_
3. **Change POC information = basic change of POC info --> Waiting for sophia**
4. **Missing file upload tab = The tabs for file upload aren't visible, sometimes because account is active in Okta but it's not associated to any provider account, sometimes it's a glitch) --> waiting for sophia**
5. _Reset Password = missed there's a "forgot password?" link on login screen or they've been locked out which isn't resolved by resetting password. --> I added explicit words "reset password" to the login page so this nugget is more findable._&#x20;

### Common questions via helpdesk (contact us form)

_Note: we should aim to have common questions addressed and easily findable in this gitbook -- however, some questions will be better served by talking to a human so for those, we may just want to make sure they can easily figure out they need to talk to a human and how to do this._

1. How do I get my location added to Vaccines.gov? / How do I get my location removed from Vaccines.gov? --> covered
2. I'm in the process of getting set up but need help.
   1. Should be covered by About / enroll / contact us but make sure that info really pops.
3. _We submit data to Locating health but it's not showing up on vaccines.gov.--> covered_
4. _I run a mobile vaccine unit and would like to be listed._
   1. _Currently out of scope, human support best fit for answering, not the documentation._
5. _\[inventory/ location data] on the site is wrong --> covered_
6. **How do I get my location to show appointment availability like the others? --> waiting for Sophia**
   1. Might be a combo of people who's stock hasn't been updated recently enough or they're just not yet set up to provide this data.&#x20;
   2. Think about how these people will find the answer to their question here... for the later, we should make sure we have info that explains how it works to get your location to show apt availability (ie FHIR spec instructions / process info)
7. Why does my location not show in results --> covered
